Thermopt is a home heating optimisation tool that reduces unnecessary energy usage and costs. Thermopt works by using a PIR sensor to detect motion in a particular area or room. This motion suggests usage of a room and logs the usage into the device's database. This data is then used to calculate the key times that a room is used, for example a living room may only be used between 6-9 every evening. This data is then used to calculate the key times that a room is used, for example a living room may only be used between 6-9 every evening. The device can calculate this key usage time and heat the room automatically accordingly. This both saves heating costs and is beneficial for the environment. Over time, the device can learn key usage times and so, predict how the room's heating should be configured.
