          <p>I decided to base my project on the subject of energy conservation after reading recent UN reports related to climate change and the worsening of atmospheric conditions, such as the report titled “IPCC | Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation, Vulnerability”.</p><br>
          <p>During the course of my research, I noted that the US Department of Energy states that devices that use unnecessary power account for up to 10% of a homeowner’s electricity use. The bulk of this usage is made up of inefficient home heating and sporadic usage of lights in the home, often when unnecessary.</p><br>
          <p>I knew initially from my own experience that often, areas of the house are heated unnecessarily, for example bedrooms being heated throughout the day. If a computational and tactical approach was integrated into most homes, a more efficient and economic energy system could be created, saving money and the environment.</p><br>
          <p>I brainstormed several ideas for a project and possible solution to the problem at hand. Initially I contemplated a full electricity monitoring system for the home. The system would modernise older home electricity supplies by transforming them to a piece of Smart technology. This would involve a single board computer, known as a Raspberry Pi, to be integrated into the household's electrical system. The device could control the household's electricity usage and optimise it to reduce energy waste. Ultimately, I found the task to be too large and decided it would be too ambitious and unrealistic for the project to be completed in the time frame. Next, I debated creating a budget-friendly smart-plug adaptor. This adapter would be composed of an Arduino Uno or Raspberry Pi and in conjunction with an electricity monitoring system so that once a defined level of electricity is used, the plug adapter would disconnect from the grid stopping the flow of electricity. The smart-adapter would thus save power and energy usage. However, upon further research I found that this product niche was already being satisfied and thus would not be a nuanced or unique project.</p><br>
          <p>I chose my company name to be "Eneropt", as I plan to specialise my company in products that focus on optimising energy usage in the home (E.g. Heat, Lighting and Fuel). My final choice of product is called Thermopt. It is a home heating optimisation tool that reduces unnecessary energy usage and costs. Thermopt works by employing a PIR sensor to detect motion in a particular area or room. This motion suggests that a room is being used and logs that usage into the device's database. This data is then used to calculate the key times that a room is used, for example a living room may only be used between 6-9 every evening. Over time the device can then predict this key usage time and heat the room automatically accordingly. This both saves heating costs and is beneficial for the environment. It also means the home owner need not worry so much about setting timers etc. since the device learns the household habits and adapts the heating system to suit. This project appears to be cost effective enough to be affordable to most demographics as it has the ability to be scaled to different price ranges depending on the demand. It could be integrated into most homes with relative ease and in doing so, may create a more efficient and economic way of controlling heating at home. It would also tie closely into the issues that peaked my interest in relation to the unnecessary use of standby energy.</p><br>
          <p>Throughout the course of my research, I discovered several pre-existing systems that employed elements and features that I could potentially come to include in my project. Firstly, the “Hive” app has the capability to control and monitor heating using smart controls. Hive can monitor and integrate home heating habits for its users and relay that information in a clear and useful manner. With a base price of 150 Euro, its service would be classed in the non-budget range. It would be mostly used by those building or renovating properties due to its installation process. It notably lacks the optimisation features that my project will seek to create and provide. Secondly, “Home Energy” is a product by the company “Sense”, it automatically identifies devices in your home, and using the mobile app, delivers notifications and updates to see what appliances might have been left running, while tracking your month-over-month energy statistics. The Sense Energy Monitor is available for a base price of 275 Euros making it a premium product. Its main market demographics are technology enthusiasts and environmentalists, however, its price range makes it unavailable for many. This is an issue I plan to address by choosing cost effective components.
</p><br>
          <p>I know from prior experience with basic electronics projects that the easiest way to detect motion using a Raspberry Pi 4, which I intend to use, is a PIR Sensor. This can be integrated relatively easily at a relatively low cost. As well as this, I am briefly familiar with SQLite databases and I will potentially utilise such a database during the course of my project.</p><br>
          <p>I do not believe that my project poses any large ethical or social implications, however, the monitoring of motion data and time data may perhaps be viewed by some as an invasion of privacy and personal data. To avoid this, I plan to host all data collection locally on the device and allow it to be gathered on a local server. This would minimise the amount of contact the data has with outsider service providers and other third parties.</p><br>
          <p>GDPR is the regulation on the protection of people with regard to the processing of personal data. I have decided my website should be fully GDPR compliant to follow my school’s GDPR policy. All names, addresses, faces and other personal information are fictional and will be generated using AI based services such as: thispersondoesnotexist.com.</p><br>
          <p>The 7 principles of universal design are the core part of a framework created to provide criteria that would allow nearly anyone to evaluate products and environments for usability. They are comprised of Equitable Use, Flexibility in Use, Simple and Intuitive Use, Perceptible Information, Tolerance for Error, Low Physical Effort and Size and Space for Approach and Use. My artefact design satisfies these principles. To do this, I ensured the artefact was useful to people with diverse abilities - the artefact was designed to be useful to all regardless of level of ability; the design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities - the artefact website can be used regardless of device type thanks to its responsive design, the artefact's use was designed to be easy to understand, regardless of the user’s experience and the artefact website design communicates the information effectively to the user through its clear and easy to understand design. As well as this, the physical design of the artefact ensures a minimization of hazards and comfortable use.</p><br>
          <p>There are several key groups and enterprises that I believe would be potential stakeholders in a product such as the one I am creating. This could include the ESB, who promote such energy saving products and services, which my product would fall under. More directly, the Irish government via the SEAI is known to provide funding towards projects such as this one that fall under the category of “environmental protection” or other similar topics. The end user for my product would be that of homeowners or renters, aged approximately 18+, of any income level and property size. Although I do note for full integration into the property’s heating system it may be unsuitable for those who rent.</p><br>
