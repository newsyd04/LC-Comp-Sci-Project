          <h2>Week 1:</h2>
          <br>
          <p>I began by defining the problem I would attempt to solve. After deciding on a problem and topic to base my project on I began to research the issue in more detail. I collected information and statistics to narrow down the focus of my project. I created approximately 3 main potential solutions for the issue and then eliminated two based on their effectiveness and my ability to create said solutions. I then began to analyse how I would go about solving the problem with the solution I had chosen. </p>

          <p>I have developed the main landing page of the website and have begun to design a team page. I found the website “thispersondoesnotexist.com” to be useful in creating artificial profiles for my team.</p>
